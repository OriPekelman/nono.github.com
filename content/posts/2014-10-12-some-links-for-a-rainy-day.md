It's sunday, it's raining, so I've decided to geek. I've rebuilt this blog.
Yeah, again ! And to test it, what's better than publishing a new post? So,
I've put here 5 links to keep you busy too:


## [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/)

Hugo is a fast and modern static website engine. You write some markdown, you
run hugo and it generates a static website, that you can host on github pages
for example. It's what I'm using now for this blog.

It's a young project, but it's already very usable, a bit more generic and
powerful than Jekyll. [The documentation](http://gohugo.io/overview/introduction)
is nice. Since it's written in golang, it's very fast. And the live reload is
so cool!


## [Sweet Alert](https://github.com/t4t5/sweetalert)

JavaScript's alert and confirm are common. But they are ugly. It was time to
have a replacement for them. This JS library is easy to install and use. And
it offers a nice Wow effect for your users.


## [Live blogging of dotGo](http://dotgo.sourcegraph.com/)

Sourcegraph has live blogged the dotGo conference. If you are interested by
golang, you should read it. You can learn some news, like the new
[gorename](https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/cmd/gorename/main.go?repo=tools)
command.


## [The Mature Optimization Handbook](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/the-mature-optimization-handbook/10151784131623920)

Carlos Bueno, an engineer at Facebook, has written an handbook about when and
how optimize our code. I've just read the first sections, but it seems like a
very valuable read.


## [Code Fights](https://codefights.com/)

This game has only one rule:

> _There is one logic bug on one line of this JS code. Find it, fix it, hit submit!_

After several tries, my best score is 942. Can you beat it?
